# robot_code_2023

This is the source code for all of FIRST Robotics Competition team 6357, The Spring Konstant's code for the 2023 FRC game, "Charged Up". The Spring Konstant is a FIRST Robotics Competition team based out of Dripping Springs, Texas made up of about 40, 9th - 12th graders from Dripping Springs High School. 6357 has been to the world championships in Houston in 2017 and 2018, and in 2018 started FTC team 13760 at Sycamore Springs Middle School. We are consistently involved in STEM outreach events whether through STEM day, Christmas on Mercer, Science Nights and other community actvities.

All new code work is done on the "develop" branch. Latest, tested code is merged onto the "main" branch. At competitions, work is performed on the "competition" branch and merged to "develop" once tested before being merged back to "main" on return to the school.
